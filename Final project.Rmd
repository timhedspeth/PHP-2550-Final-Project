# Introduction
## Motivating question 


## Literature review 


# Data Overview 

## What data are we using 
In this toy example I have downloaded data from a random strain of salmonella as to to explore what we can do with this data. 

```{r}

library(lubridate)

# Read in the data 
setwd("~/Desktop/Semester_3/Practical/Final")
isolated <- read.csv("isolates_test.csv")

apply(isolated, 2, typeof)

head(isolated)

table(isolated$Location)
nrow(isolated)

#isolated_us <- 
```

All the data reads in as character. There are 17,328 in this data set allone hailing from many countries around the world
