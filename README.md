# PHP 2550 Final Project
## Food Borne Pathogens 

Hi! Welcome to our project page! We are a group of graduate students in the department of Biostatistics at Brown University School of Public Health. We are working on a project regarding the outbreak of foodborne illnesses in the United States. In short we will attempt to apply machine learning and time series analyses to build robust models and framework that can be used as predictive tools for public officials that may not be well versed in statisical analysis. The main objective of which will be to predict potential future outbreaks of food borne illness in the United States, hopefully helping public health officials in the future.

This work is currently ongoing, as this course runs for the fall 2022 semester.  At this point in time our analysis is focused on exploring the data, regarding Salmonella, E. Coli, and Campylobacter. In our EDA working with the [pathogens data from NCBI](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pathogens/), we explored both spatial (regions of the United States) and temporal (2013-2022) trends in the number of cases of each illness. This will lay the ground work for us to apply machine learning time series or other statistical methodlogies to the data to answer our question of interest. Thus we will be continually updating this repository, we currently have a folder for our initial analysis, that will serve as a building block for the rest of this project. The code and associated data used for the exploratory analysis is avilable in the [Initial Work](https://github.com/timhedspeth/PHP-2550-Final-Project/tree/main/Initial%20work) folder. We have last updated this repository (10/23/22).
