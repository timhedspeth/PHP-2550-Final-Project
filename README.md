# PHP 2550 Final Project
## Food Borne Pathogens 

Hello and welcome to our project about X Y and Z. We are a group of graduate students in the department of Biostatistics at
Brown University School of Public Health. For our course in Pratical Data Analysis we have worked on  preditcting food outbreaks. This repository contains 
all the code and figures that were derived from this analysis. This repository will be frequently updated until 12/15/22, and likely will remain untouched 
from then on.
